PURPOSE: The purpose of Bullseye ECS was to have the 5 of us brainstorm an idea, plan development, and bring our project to light. Weekly deliverables were made to track progress and maintain consistent progress of meeting system requirements in the SRS document. The Bullseye ECS allowed us to get hands-on experience with Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) principles and to incorporate AGILE methodologies to deliver and showcase the project on time.
